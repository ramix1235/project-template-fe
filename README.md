# Template for Single Page Application (SPA)

## Description

The template provides a set of settings and features that are usually required in medium-sized SPA project. Richness of functionality depends on the selected git branch.

## Branches

- main - overview of the repository.
- vite-ts-min - implements a minimal project structure with recommended development configuration.
- vite-ts - extends vite-ts-min branch with a services-based project structure in which components use functionality isolated into services for better modularity.
- vite-ts-tests - extends vite-ts branch with a testing environment and set of already written tests.

_Note: detailed overview of each branch can be found in their own readme._

## Infrastructure

- [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) - allows quickly install and use different versions of Node.js via the command line.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) - JS runtime environment that runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes JS code outside a web browser.
- [Corepack](https://github.com/nodejs/corepack) - distributed by default with all recent Node.js versions and allows use yarn, npm, and pnpm without having to install them.
- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io) - disk space-efficient package manager that uses a unique symlink-based approach to manage dependencies. [Why not yarn/npm](https://refine.dev/blog/pnpm-vs-npm-and-yarn/#why-not-npm-or-yarn).
- [GIT](https://git-scm.com/) - version control system.
- [Vite environments](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode) - env variables for development, staging, production modes.
