# Template for Single Page Application (SPA)

## Description
The template provides a set of settings and features that are usually required in medium-sized SPA project. Richness of functionality depends on the selected git branch.

## Branches
- #### main
  Overview of the repository.

- #### vite-ts-min
  Development configuration - for quickly starting a project from scratch.

- #### vite-ts
  Implements a services-based project structure in which components use functionality isolated into services for better modularity. 
  
  _Note: services still depend on the project. For absolute independence, the repository should use [pnpm workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) or [Nx](https://nx.dev) and become a monorepository where services are packages with their own package.json, tsconfig.json, etc._

  Features:
  - Development configuration - copy of vite-ts-min branch.
  - Design - set of components, set of hooks for state and UI management, set of icons, notifications management, forms management, theme management and theme select component.
  - Data management - store and cache management for authorization and API.
  - Navigation - routing for pages which are described below.
  - Internationalization - translations and language select component.
  - Validations - schema-based validations for forms.
  - Permissions - access restriction for pages/components/logic.
  - Authorization - basic auth token-based flow.

## Infrastructure
- [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) - allows quickly install and use different versions of Node.js via the command line.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) - JS runtime environment that runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes JS code outside a web browser.
- [Corepack](https://github.com/nodejs/corepack) - distributed by default with all recent Node.js versions and allows use yarn, npm, and pnpm without having to install them.
- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io) - disk space-efficient package manager that uses a unique symlink-based approach to manage dependencies. [Why not yarn/npm](https://refine.dev/blog/pnpm-vs-npm-and-yarn/#why-not-npm-or-yarn).
- [GIT](https://git-scm.com/) - version control system.
- [Vite environments](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode) - env variables for development, staging, production modes.

## Getting Started
1. Setup Node.js (recommended via NVM) - check Vite [compatibility note](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project).
2. Setup PNPM (recommended via Corepack).
1. ``pnpm run dev`` - run the development server and http://localhost:4200 automatically opens in the browser.
2. Check all TODO comments in the whole project to customize the template for yourself and remove stubs and mocks.
3. ``pnpm run codegen:openapi`` - run the API code generation command.

## Deployment
1. ``pnpm run build`` - run the production build command.
2. Check dist folder in the project root.
